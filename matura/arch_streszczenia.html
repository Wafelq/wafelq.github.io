					Dzień dobry! Kłania się przed wami Mateusz Hajduga, pseudonim "Wafelq". Urodzony 5 lipca 2006, od zawsze fascynowałem się tworzeniem filmów, a w szczególności YouTubem. Jest coś wspaniałego w naszych czasach ze kazdy kto ma dobra kamere i mikrofon (a oba znajdziemy w prawie kazdym z naszych telefonow) moze w tym serwisie rozkrecic kariere (krótszą lub dłuzsza, ale jednak!)
				<br><br>
					Od małego więc, miałem małe marzenie o zostaniu "twórcą internetowym" (zartuje se, chodzi o bycie YouTuberem :P). 
				<br><br>
					Right now we are working on an RPG called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/">Heartbound</a>. It's an adventure that focuses heavily on player choice and I stream all of the development live every day on <a href="https://piratesoftware.live">Twitch</a>. Heartbound made it through Steam Greenlight in 11 days as the top voted submission across the entire platform. We then ran a successful Kickstarter campaign that hit 385% of its funding goal. At the time of this writing Heartbound is in Early Access on Steam and voted 97% positive out of 1,213 reviews. It's been translated into six languages and is really well liked all over the world.
				<br><br>
					Listed below are all of the bits of advice that I have for anyone wanting to get into making games. Understand that this line of work is not for everyone. It's not easy. It can be boring at times. It can be soul crushing at times. Just like any other job. That being said it can also be the most fulfilling thing you've ever done in your life. There is nothing that compares to someone playing your creation and enjoying it.

				<h1>What skills do I need?</h1>
				<div class="text-seperator"></div>
				<br><br>
					What if I told you that you didn't need any? Well guess what. You don't. We live in a time where you can learn anything you need to make a game with relative ease. Despite what you may think none of that comes from natural talent. We all just pour our hours into getting better at what we do. You can do the same. Below you will find some examples of games that are already out there that help reinforce this.

				<br><br>
					<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220780/Thomas_Was_Alone/">Thomas Was Alone</a> is made of rectangles. All of it. Even the particles. It will also make you cry. Thomas Was Alone is a masterclass in minimalist art and fantastic voice over. You can make simple shapes. You can learn to make particles out of simple shapes. You can create a shell of a game that accomplishes the same basic goals as Thomas Was Alone. You can make a game.

				<br><br>
					<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/410670/Suits_A_Business_RPG/">Suits A Business RPG</a> was made with incredibly simplistic pixel art and drawn pencil images that are scanned into a computer. It's entirely unique and incredible. This shows that you can really break out of standard game visuals and still succeed. You can draw doodles on paper. You can make a game.

				<br><br>
					<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/597220/West_of_Loathing/">West of Loathing</a> is the glorious successor to Kingdom of Loathing. It's also entirely stick figures and insane humor. The cartoony simplistic figures really help lean in to the rest of the story and jokes in a way that makes it all even funnier. You can make a stick man. You can make a game.

				<br><br>
					<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/789570/Nepenthe/">Nepenthe</a> takes a similar route as Suits A Business RPG. It was made entirely in colored pencil, scanned into a computer, and used as tiles and assets. The effect ends up making a really unique and surreal adventure. You can draw doodles on paper. You can make a game.

				<br><br>
					Yes, that's right. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/">Undertale</a> is a damn incredible game. It has a unique combat style, great story, the puzzles are ok, and the dad jokes are plentiful. Toby Fox was a much more novice programmer at the time and the code base has some incredibly odd choices throughout it. Does it matter? Is the game less fun? Protip: It doesn't matter. You can learn programming as you go. You can make a game.

				<br><br>
					<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435400/Hidden_Folks/">Hidden Folks</a> is effectively an evolution on Where's Waldo and while it's simple in concept it's super well executed. The wild thing that sets it apart is the audio. Everything... and I do mean everything, is mouth sounds. All of the music, the effects, all of it was made with someones face. It's incredible. You have a face. You can make a game.

				<h1>What kind of game should I make?</h1>
				<div class="text-seperator"></div>
				<br><br>
					Everyone wants to make the biggest most impressive game they've ever seen at first. They want to show it off for clout and admiration from others. They want to make something worthy of praise. Many of us want to make our dream game right off the bat and just amaze everyone with how awesome we are. Don't. Don't make that game as your first game.
				<br><br>
					If you make your dream game it's the same as fighting the final boss at level one. You need to build up a little bit of know-how by grinding lower level mobs first. You need to learn what kind of developer you are. You need to learn what kinds of games you like making not just the ones you like playing. You need to find your style and form your niche in the world of game development. We all have a voice and making something small helps you find yours.
				<br><br>
					This doesn't mean you need to go sadly run yourself through tutorials or miles of projects that will never see the light of day. It means you should develop something small with the intention of releasing it and getting feedback so you can level up. Play dungeons and dragons and DM a few games with a custom world you built. Make an arcade game, launch it, and get feedback from people. Join a bunch of Game Jams and feel out how you like working with others or what works best for a team. Grow yourself so you can make great games.
				<br><br>
					One of the best ways to start this process is by building a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vl7BMvzUOhbunJrI_X1gUc6x-LAp3aaBiPwHUf27B70">Game Design Document</a>. This is a living document to help you organize your entire project and stay in scope. It also lets you investigate different engines or languages that may work with the kind of game you're making before you commit. Overall a GDD saves you time and money and is always beneficial.
				<br><br>
					Even with all of my prior experience I had no idea what I was doing when I went indie at first. I had never launched a game outside of a triple A studio. I had never launched a demo or built a community. We used our first game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/454380/Champions_of_Breakfast/">Champions of Breakfast</a> to do that. We went through Steam Greenlight, made all the icons, learned how to build achievements, Steam trading cards, made a Discord, made a Twitter, reached out to streamers, and everything else that a studio needs to know. 
				<br><br>
					Our little game didn't do very well but it taught us everything we needed to know to make <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/">Heartbound</a> succeed. Champions of Breakfast was made in twenty four days from concept to release on Steam and it is by far the most important step we ever took as a studio.
